<!-- Load Bootstrap via CDN
The CDN is fine for now.
    using the remote method is a good idea as many users will already have
   the file in the cache of their browser from loading other Bootstrap-based
    websites. If that is the case, they won’t have to reload it when coming
   to your site, leading to faster page loading time. As a consequence,
   this is the recommended method for live sites.
  However, for experimenting and development, or if you want to be independent
  of an Internet connection, you can also get your own copy of the files.
   This is what we’re doing for this Bootstrap tutorial because it also
   results in less code we need to post.

<!-- INCLUDE THE JQUERY
In order to get the full functionality of Bootstrap, you also need to load
 the jQuery library. Here, too, you have the possibility to load it remotely
 or host it locally.

(Quick note: Bootstrap 5, which is currently in Beta status, will stop using
jQuery and use plain JavaScript instead. We will address the upcoming change below.
 However, for the current version, Bootstrap 4, you still need jQuery,
 so this tutorial will include it.)
